EDAE is an MTA for OS MISS.

Warning: This repository is for educational purposes, and thus was
transcoded from MISS Code to UTF-8. Therefore, even if someone were
to find (either of) Venguerov's C compiler, the repository isn't
going to build correctly. The archive includes text messages and
those must be in MISS Code in order to work correctly.
